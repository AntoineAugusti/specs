Introduction
============

Open Geospatial Consortium is a consortium of companies, universities and governments that have specified and agreed on a number of dataprotocols and formats in the spatial domain. 

A [cat-interop](https://github.com/OSGeo/Cat-Interop) initiative sat together at [Foss4g nottingham](http://2013.foss4g.org) (2013) and [Foss4g Portland](http://2014.foss4g.org) (2014) to discuss better interopability in the spatial data sharing domain. This lead to a first initiative to set up a list of protocols and formats to be used in dataset metadata. The full list can be found [here](https://github.com/OSGeo/Cat-Interop/blob/master/LinkPropertyLookupTable.csv).

On these pages a summary on each of the spatial protocols & formats with links to the relevant documentation.

Protocols
=========

* [Catalog Service for the Web](protocols/csw.md)
* [GeoSMS](protocols/geosms.md)
* [Sensor Things](protocols/iot.md)
* [Open Location Services](protocols/openls.md)
* [Sensor Observation Services](protocols/sos.md)
* [Web Coverage Service](protocols/wcs.md)
* [Web Feature Service](protocols/wfs.md)
* [Web Map Service](protocols/wms.md)
* [Web Map Tile Service](protocols/wmts.md) (also mentioned; TMS, WMS-c, vector-tiles)

Formats
=======

* [Augmented Reality Markup Language](formats/arml.md)
* [GeoPackage](formats/geopackage.md)
* [Geography Markup Language](formats/gml.md) (also mentioned; geojson, topojson, geobuf) 
* [Keyhole Markup Language](formats/kml.md)
* [Observations and Measurements](formats/om.md)
* [Well Known Text](formats/wkt.md)
 

Compliance testing
==================

OGC sponsors the development of validation tooling, [CITE Team Engine](https://github.com/opengeospatial/teamengine), with which developers can make sure there software aligns with the standard. If the tests run fine, you can claim [OGC compliance](http://www.opengeospatial.org/compliance) for your product.
