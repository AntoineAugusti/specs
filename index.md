This site is the home for *specifications* related to **Frictionless
Data.**

**Frictionless Data** is about removing the friction in working with
data through the development of a set of tools, specifications, and
best practices for publishing data. The heart of Frictionless Data is
*Data Package*, a containerization format for any kind of data based
on existing practices for publishing open-source software.

For more info about the project as a whole, please visit

### DataProtocols

The Frictionless Data specifications grew out of **DataProtocols**, a
community effort for defining **simple protocols and formats for
working with open data** originally hosted at **dataprotocols.org**.

All other specifications can still be found at the new home for
DataProtocols, [specs.okfnlabs.org](http://specs.okfnlabs.org).
