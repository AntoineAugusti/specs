This site is the home for *specifications* related to **Frictionless
Data.**

**Frictionless Data** is about removing the friction in working with
data through the development of a set of tools, specifications, and
best practices for publishing data. The heart of Frictionless Data is
*Data Package*, a containerization format for any kind of data based
on existing practices for publishing open-source software.

For more info about the project as a whole, please visit

## Specifications

### Core

- [Data Packages](/data-packages/)
- [JSON Table Schema](/json-table-schema/)
- [CSV Dialect Description](/csv-dialect/)
- [Data Package Identifiers](/data-package-identifier/)

### Data Package Profiles

- [Tabular Data Package](/tabular-data-package/)
- [Fiscal Data Package](/fiscal-data-package/)

## Patterns

Usage of the Frictionless Data specifications has led to the emerge of certain patterns to facilitate common data handling use cases. The patterns we identify here are those that are either implemented in the core libraries for Frictionless Data in Python and JavaScript, or, are commonly used and are candidates for inclusion in the specifications at a later stage.

## DataProtocols

The Frictionless Data specifications grew out of **DataProtocols**, a
community effort for defining **simple protocols and formats for
working with open data** originally hosted at **dataprotocols.org**.

All other specifications can still be found at the new home for
DataProtocols, [specs.okfnlabs.org](http://specs.okfnlabs.org).

## Participate and Contribute

This effort is community-run and contributions, comments and corrections are
warmly welcomed. Most work proceeds in an RFC-style manner with discussion on
the [forum][forum].

Material is kept in a [git repo on GitHub][repo] - fork and submit a pull
request to add material. There is also an [issue tracker][issues] which can be
used for specific issues or suggestions.
